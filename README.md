# 🔷 Area Calculator in C++

This is a simple and beginner-friendly C++ program that helps you calculate the area of different 2D shapes. It runs in the console and uses a basic `switch-case` structure to handle user choices.

### 📐 What Shapes Can It Handle?
You can calculate the area of:
- ✅ Circle
- ✅ Rectangle
- ✅ Square
- ✅ Triangle
- ✅ Parallelogram
- ✅ Trapezium

### 💡 How It Works
Just run the program, pick the shape you're interested in, enter the required values (like radius, base, height, etc.), and it gives you the area. It’s a great way to practice basic C++ concepts like:
- User input/output
- Conditional statements
- Simple math operations

### 🧪 Sample Output


1- Area of Circle
2- Area of Rectangle
3- Area of Square
4- Area of Triangle
5- Area of Parallelogram
6- Area of Trapezium
Enter your choice :: 1
Enter the radius of the Circle :: 5

Area :: 78.5



### 🧠 Why Use This?
- Great for students or anyone new to C++
- Helps reinforce concepts like `switch-case`, `cin/cout`, and math operations
- Easy to extend with more shapes or features
